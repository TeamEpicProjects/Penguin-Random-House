# Penguin-Random-House, by Ramanpreet Kaur


## Executive summary - Tl;Dr;
Developed web crawlers, featurized the text and trained the ML algorithm to classify reviews and build a dashboard.

## Goals
Penguin Random House is a global trade publisher known for publishing in diverse languages publishing e-books and audio books across genres like fiction, non-fiction, thrillers, memoirs, health and so on. Since Penguin Random House products are distributed over various channels, they want to understand how it is received by the customers. They want to build a review collecting system to understand the customers better. The system should help to collect reviews from sources like Amazon, Goodreads.

## Milestones, code and tech
The project was composed by 3 milestones

## Milestone 1: crawling Amazon and Goodreads
Add here a glance of the inputs and outputs, technology used and a link to the jupyter notebook.
Also, you're encouraged to add your critical summary (based on data) for each milestone

## Milestone 2: extract the sentiment from each review via NLP
sentiment analysis helps to understand the customer like and dislike about product
Sentiment Analysis is the automated process of understanding the sentiment or opinion of a given text . We can use it to automatically analyze product reviews and sort them by Positive , Neutral , Negative
##Improve Result
Cleaned the reviews using Regular Expressions
Extracted features from text using TF-IDF
Created a Binary text classifier using SGD Classifier
Output is Polarity - Positive(1) or Negative(0)
Used GridSearchCV for Cross Validation
Improvised the results by implementing Deep Learning Techniques : ANN , RNN[LSTM]
Activation Function - Sigmoid ; Optimizer - Adam ; Loss Function - Binary_Crossentropy

## Milestone 3: visualisation of the results, for product managers and exec management
Cleaned the reviews using Regular Expressions

Extracted features from text using Count Vectorizer

Created a multinominal text classifier using Multinominal Naive Bayes Classifier

Output is Polarity - Positive(1), Negative(-1) or Neutral(0)

Got an accuracy of 81.09
